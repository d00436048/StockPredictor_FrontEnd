# StockML Web App

**StockML** is a web application built with Flask (Python) and JavaScript, designed to run a machine learning model on the backend to predict stock prices. It features a simple interface for users to input stock data and view predictions generated by the model. The backend is connected to a SQLite database to manage historical data and support the ML pipeline.

The app includes basic user authentication with password hashing for security. User sessions are managed with Flask and encrypted to keep data safe. This project serves as a lightweight, full-stack demo of integrating machine learning into a web environment with a focus on usability, security, and modular design.
